  - Click-to-view details
- **Territory Visualization**: Color-coded regions showing each salesman's assigned territory
- **Route Lines**: Visual paths showing planned routes between shops

### 2. Territory Assignment & Clustering
- **Automatic Clustering**: Algorithm-based territory division based on:
  - Number of available salesmen
  - Shop density and geographic distribution
  - Distance optimization
- **Cluster Visualization**: Each territory displayed with distinct colors

### Data Structure:
```javascript
{
  salesmen: [
    {
      id: "salesman_1",
      name: "John Doe",
      territory: ["shop_1", "shop_2", "shop_3"],
      routes: [...]
    }
  ],
  shops: [
    {
      id: "shop_1",
      name: "ABC Hardware",
      coordinates: {lat: 40.7128, lng: -74.0060},
      priority: "high",
      status: "pending"
    }
  ],
  territories: [
    {
      id: "territory_1",
      salesman_id: "salesman_1",
      shops: [...],
      color: "#FF6B6B"
    }
  ]
}
```
