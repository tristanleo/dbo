  - Click-to-view details
- **Territory Visualization**: Color-coded regions showing each salesman's assigned territory
- **Route Lines**: Visual paths showing planned routes between shops

### 2. Territory Assignment & Clustering
- **Automatic Clustering**: Algorithm-based territory division based on:
  - Number of available salesmen
  - Shop density and geographic distribution
  - Distance optimization
- **Cluster Visualization**: Each territory displayed with distinct colors
- **Salesman Assignment**: Clear labeling of which salesman covers which territory

### 3. Manual Route Adjustment
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Ability to move shops between territories
- **Lasso Selection Tool**: Free-form area selection tool for assigning shops to territories
  - Click and drag to draw custom shapes
  - Automatically selects shops within the drawn area
  - Visual feedback with high-visibility traces
  - Assigns selected shops to the currently selected territory
- **Route Planning Tools**: 
  - Click-to-add waypoints
  - Drag to reorder stops
  - Split/merge territories
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate visual feedback when making changes

### 4. Route Guidance & Optimization
- **Smart Suggestions**: AI-powered recommendations for:
  - Optimal route sequences
  - Territory rebalancing
  - Time-efficient paths

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Technologies:
- **Map Engine**: Leaflet.js for interactive mapping
- **UI Framework**: React.js for component-based interface
- **Styling**: CSS Grid/Flexbox for responsive layout
- **State Management**: React hooks for route data

### Core Algorithms:
- **Clustering**: K-means or hierarchical clustering for territory division
- **Route Optimization**: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) algorithms
- **Distance Calculation**: Haversine formula for geographic distances
- **Lasso Selection**: Point-in-polygon algorithm for area-based shop selection

### Data Structure:
```javascript
{
  salesmen: [
    {
      id: "salesman_1",
      name: "John Doe",
      territory: ["shop_1", "shop_2", "shop_3"],
      routes: [...]
    }
  ],
  shops: [
    {
      id: "shop_1",
      name: "ABC Hardware",
      coordinates: {lat: 40.7128, lng: -74.0060},
      priority: "high",
      status: "pending"
    }
  ],
  territories: [
    {
      id: "territory_1",
      salesman_id: "salesman_1",
      shops: [...],
      color: "#FF6B6B"
    }
  ]
}
```

## User Workflow

### 1. Initial Setup
- Upload or input shop location data
- Set number of salesmen
- Configure optimization preferences

### 2. Territory Assignment
- Use automatic clustering to create initial territories
- **Lasso Tool Workflow**:
  - Select a territory from the left sidebar
  - Click the "ðŸŽ¯ Lasso Tool" button in the right sidebar
  - Click and drag on the map to draw a custom selection area
  - Release to automatically assign shops within the area to the selected territory
  - Visual feedback shows the drawn area and selected shops
- Manually adjust territories by dragging shops between areas

### 3. Route Optimization
- Review optimization suggestions
- Manually reorder stops within territories
- Analyze performance metrics
- Save optimized configurations

## Lasso Tool Features

- **Selection Phase**: Red polygon with dashed border shows selected area
- **Duration**: Selection area remains visible for 3 seconds after completion
- **Enhanced Styling**: 6px stroke width, glow effects, and high contrast colors

### Technical Implementation:
- **Event Handling**: Mouse down, move, and up events for drawing
- **Path Creation**: Dynamic polyline updates during drawing
